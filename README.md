# Haskell Interpreter

This project is a simple interpreter written in Haskell. It is designed to evaluate expressions and demonstrate the power of functional programming.

The language that is interpreted is called AHA, it's syntax is block based denoted with brackets and is pretty simple. 

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Variable assignments
- Simple conditional
- Printing values

## Examples

Here are some examples of expressions you can evaluate with the interpreter:

### Basic arithmetic
```
1 + 2 * 3 / 2
```

### Variable assigment
```
x = 2
```

### Simple conditional
```
x = 10
y = 20
if x {
    result = x + y
} else {
    result = 0
}
```

### Printing values
```
x = 10
y = "Hello"
print x
print y
z = y + " World"
print z
```
